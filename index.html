					<p>Of all the rivers in the West, none offer the warm water and huge white sand beaches of the Salmon River. During your Salmon River rafting adventure, you will experience natural riparian zones unique to the North American river. Wildlife is prolific throughout the semi-arid canyonlands in one of the West's most remote areas. Sightings may include mule deer, Rocky Mountain big horn sheep, river otter, beaver, coyote, and birds of every category imaginable. The rare few may even have the pleasure of spotting a black bear or a moose! Some of the best video opportunities in Idaho!</p>
			
					<p>Fishing opportunities include small mouth bass, rainbow trout, fall steelhead and gigantic prehistoric white sturgeon. White sturgeon and wild steelhead are <em>"catch &amp; release".</em> What a family treasure that would be to have a video of you catching a 12 foot sturgeon that could potential take hours to reel in!</p>
